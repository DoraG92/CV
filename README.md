**Unipart Technology Logistics** (January 2017 to August 2019)  
_Operations colleague_

Started as a skilled technician, where I specialised in iPhone repairs, including replacement of damaged or faulty components such as displays, batteries, touch ID's and speakers, conducting in-depth investigations of faults reported by customers, performing advanced diagnostics on devices using diagnostic software, analyze error codes and perform hardware tests, as well as ensuring that billing is thoroughly reviwed and verified before the repaired devices are sent back to the customers. I then quickly progressed into a supervisor role where I was responsible for managing people according to Daily Stock report, making sure standard operating procedures(SOPs) are up to date, ensuring a continuous flow of the process, adjusting schedules, supporting the team with process related queries, and providing training to new team members.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

- I am a highly adaptable individual, with a proven ability to quickly acquire and apply new knowledge and skills. I have demonstrated this in a variety of fields, including previous employment, my own house renovation with no previous experience, video editing, and now coding. I am confident in my ability to excel in any task that I undertake.

#### Self-starter

My progress in programming has been driven by my self-motivation and self-discipline, refined by self-led learning at Makers, networking with software engineers at Monzo and taking on the challenge of renovating my first home with no prior experience, all of which have been critical to my growth as a programmer and as an individual.

#### Communicator

Makers has consolidated my communication skills within a coding environment, particularly when reviewing other peer's code, with an emphasis on pair programming from day one. Habitual collaborative learning engenders a deeper understanding of one's progress whilst working together to write cleaner code.

#### Problem Solver

I consider myself to be quite a good problem solver! I have to have a keen sense of observation, strong analytical skills, patience, and a good dose of creativity. I'm tipically the one people come to when they have a problem, big or small. And whether it's a technical issue, a personal crisis, or just a simple question, I'm always ready to jump in and find a solution. I might not always have all the answers, but I'm not afraid to admit it, and I'll go the extra mile to find themm, and sometimes the answer is a google search away, so hey I guess I'll do good as a software developer!
