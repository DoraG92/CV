## Dora Gores

"A jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one" (if you didn't know, this is the actual complete saying, so I had to conveniently put it in to make it not look as bad). Currently studying to become a Full Stack Junior Developer at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) and simultaniously working for [Monzo](https://monzo.com/) bank as a Customer Service Representive, where I'll become a Backend Engineer once I graduate from Makers Academy.
